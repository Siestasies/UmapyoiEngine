\brief
Defines physics-related events for collision and trigger interactions in the ECS.

Includes events signaling the beginning and end of collisions between entities,
as well as when entities enter or exit trigger volumes. Each event carries the
relevant entity IDs and uses normal priority for standard processing order.
